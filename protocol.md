This is a protocol template for an observational study, based off the combined "Strengthening and reporting of observational studies in epidemiology" [checklist](https://www.strobe-statement.org/) for cohort, case-control, and cross-over studies. The goal of this template is to use it right at the beginning of study planning as a protocol / statistical analysis plan. Kudos to [this handbook](for suggesting this idea)!

## Title and abstract

1. Title and abstract

a. *Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract*
b. *Provide in the abstract an informative and balanced summary of what was done and what was found*

## Introduction

2. Background/rationale

*Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported*

3. Objectives

*State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses*

## Methods

4. Study Design

*Present key elements of study design early in the paper*

5. Setting

*Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection*

6. Participants

a. *Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up*
b. *For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed*

7. Variables

*Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable*

8. Data sources/measurement$^*$

*For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group*

9. Bias

*Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias, including: sampling bias, measurement error (exposure and outcome), immortal time bias, time-zero bias, etc.*

10. Study size

*Explain how the study size was arrived at*

11. Quantitative variables

*Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which groupings were chosen and why*

12. Statistical methods

a. *Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding*
b. *Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions*
c. *Explain how missing data were addressed*
d. *If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed*
e. *Describe any sensitivity analyses*

## Results

13. Participants$^*$

a. *Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed*
b. *Give reasons for non-participation at each stage*
c. *Consider use of a flow diagram*

14. Descriptive data$^*$

a. *Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders*
b. *Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest*
c. *Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount)*

15. Outcome data$^*$

*Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time*

16. Main results

a. *Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included*
b. *Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized*
c. *If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period*

17. Other analyses

*Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses*

## Discussion

18. Key results 

*Summarise key results with reference to study objectives*

19. Limitations

*Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias*

20. Interpretation

*Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence*

21. Generalisability

*Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results*

## Other information

22. Funding

*Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based*
